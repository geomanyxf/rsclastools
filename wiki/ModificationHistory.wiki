= RSC LAS Tools Modification History =

==Version 1.6 - 25/9/2011==
  * Added a check box to use the proper temp directory for the operating system (uncheck to use to directory the LAS data is in)
  * Fixed several bugs and made a number of improvements to the code for above-ground height LAS file generation
  * Fixed a major bug in the data binning that resulted in tile edges being apparent in final products based on above-ground height
  * Modified raster generation code to allow multiple layer raster products (e.g. for foliage profiles)
  * Added a canopy density decile metric that may be useful for biomass estimation
  * Fixed bug in creation of LAS extent KML files

==Version 1.5 - 7/1/2011==
  * Changed calculation of cumulative gap fraction
  * Fixed bug where incorrect height above ground data was read when generating point ASCII products
  * Fix bug where not all applicable pointFormat versions were recognised for each LAS version. This will solve a problem a number of people have run into.
  * Removed deprecated routines from source code
  * Started using sample LAS data from liblas website for testing.

==Version 1.4 - 6/1/2011==
  * Corrected calculation of apparent foliage profiles
  * Fixed bug where incorrect minX and minY header values were assigned during tiling
  * Fixed bug where vertices array used to create extent shp/kml files was 1D instead of 2D
  * Added area, centroid (x,y) and perimeter as attributes in extent shapefiles
  * Added option when creating extent shp/kml to use extents from header instead of point data
  * Rewrote code to merge las files to be more memory efficient and stricter with output LAS header values

== Version 1.3 - 21/12/2010 ==
  * Updated to read/write LAS 1.3 (there is currently no functionality to process waveform data packets)
    * Added variable length record header viewer
    * Removed 3D data viewer.
  * More bug fixes, more to come

== Version 1.2 - 22/11/2010 ==
  * Implemented on-the-fly tiling for:
    * generation of AGH LAS files
    * ground filtering
  * Minor syntax changes
  * Source code added to SVN

== Version 1.1 - 19/11/2010 ==
  * Numerous bug fixes. It now actually works :-/
  * Added function to recalculate LAS header fields

== Version 1.0 - 18/10/2010 ==
  * Added to Google Code for testing
